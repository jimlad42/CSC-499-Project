CSC-499-Project
Takes an unsorted list from "Sort Me.txt", and sorts by name length, and then alphabetically, into "Sorted List.txt"
If the argument "-r" is added, it will reverse the resulting list.

Test.sh will run the code in both forward and reverse modes, and compare the outputs to ForwardResult.txt and ReverseResult.txt
